## Shop Management System

This project is a comprehensive shop management system designed to handle various types of users interacting with the shop's functionalities. The system allows customers to register themselves, view products, make purchases, leave ratings and comments on products, and communicate with managers regarding their orders. Managers, on the other hand, have extensive control over orders, products, and store information.

### Features

- **User Management**: The system accommodates different types of users with varying levels of access. Customers and store employees/managers can connect using their credentials and access functionalities tailored to their roles. Passwords are securely hashed in the database for authentication.

- **Customer Features**: Customers can browse products, leave ratings and comments, view purchase history, cancel orders, and interact with managers regarding their orders.

- **Manager Features**: Managers have full control over orders, products, and store information. They can assign responsible managers to orders, manage product inventory, and oversee store operations.

- **Commenting System**: Both customers and managers can write and reply to comments on products, with the depth of comments being unlimited.

- **Order Management**: Orders can be filtered by various attributes such as creation dates, statuses, and customers. Managers can also assign orders and mark urgent orders that require immediate attention.

- **Statistics**: The system provides statistical insights, including sales data, order counts, and more, presented in both textual and graphical formats.

- **Desktop and Online Systems**: The system consists of two subsystems: a desktop application and an online web server, providing flexibility and accessibility to users.

### Technologies Used

- **Languages**: Java, JavaFX, Spring (for web services)
- **Database**: MySQL
- **Other**: RESTful API for web services

### Workflow and Tasks

1. **System Design**: Design a system class diagram adhering to object-oriented principles.
2. **Implementation**: Write code for all designed classes, including CRUD functionality.
3. **Graphical User Interface**: Develop a user-friendly GUI with main windows, pop-ups, and additional windows, utilizing menu/tab bars and standard UI elements.
4. **Database Integration**: Connect to and interact with the MySQL database, including data retrieval, storage, deletion, and editing.
5. **Web Services**: Implement a RESTful API for web services, enabling data exchange between systems.

This project showcases proficiency in Java, JavaFX, Spring, MySQL, and RESTful API development, offering a robust solution for managing shop operations efficiently.
